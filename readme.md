# ESM UZIP.js

This is the [UZIP.js](https://github.com/photopea/UZIP.js) library provided as an ESM package.

## Usage

```
import UZIP from 'https://tomashubelbauer.github.io/esm-uzip-js/UZIP.js/UZIP.js';
// Usage as per https://github.com/photopea/UZIP.js#interface
```

## Stale?

As of now, the UZIP.js library is added as a submodule and updating it is done manually by
updating the submodule. This reflects on the GitHub Pages site from which the ESM library
is being referenced.

In the futute, I plan on introducing a GitHub Actions workflow which either automatically
updates the submodule daily or notifies me first so that I can consider the changes and
update myself.

## To-Do

### Develop a GitHub Actions workflow to update the UZIP.js Git submodule daily
